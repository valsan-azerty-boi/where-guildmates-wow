### This addon plays a fun sound when a guildmate login or logout.
- When a player from your guild login => you will hear a surprised peon.
- When a player from your guild logout => this time you will hear a relieved peon.
The volume is set by your master volume button in your game.

It was a fun idea from a guildmate so I did it (we have custom sounds for our characters hehe)

Created for World of Warcraft Retail and Classic on Nov 18 (2022)

### What next for futur versions ?
- For version 1.2+ => fix bugs and enhance code, add more fun rules for my own guildmates.
- For version 2.0.0 => the goal is to create the possibility to simply add audio files ("login_PlayerName.ogg" or "logout_PlayerName.ogg") in a folder ("/WhereGuildmates/sounds/custom") and the addon creates custom rules automatically at load. The goal is to make custom rules easy to add for all people, not only for me and my guildmates.
- For later => an in game interface (maybe) for managing the audio and put it on Master/SFX/Ambiant/Music (to let the user choice)
